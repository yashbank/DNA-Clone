            A map of India printed on a manifesto brought down a lot of heat on
            Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who had revealed the same earlier.
            The distorted map of India drew in a lot of criticism, prompting the
            Congress MP to issue a public apology. Shashi Tharoor, who revealed
            a map of India which had certain sections of Ladakh and Jammu and
            Kashmir omitted from the same, had to issue an apology for his
            blunder, and said that “no one does such a thing on purpose.”

          />
          <p id="Desc">
            The goof-up by Tharoor, who is running for the president’s post of
            the country’s oldest party does not show good precedent. Later
            Tharoor rectified the blunder by replacing it with the correct map
            of India in his election manifesto. Despite the apologies and
            retraction of the map shared by him, this is not the first time that
            Tharoor came under fire for sharing a distorted map of India in the
            public forum. In 2019, the Congress MP shared a map where the
            northernmost territory of the country remained missing. In December
            2019, he shared the cover of a booklet about the Kerala Congress’s
            protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). He later
            deleted the tweet and rectified his mistake. This comes as Tharoor
            remains one of the top candidates who is contesting the Congress
            presidential polls, against senior party leader Mallikarjun Kharge,
            who is reportedly being backed by the Gandhis for the top post.
